# Backlog

Deferred work and known issues for Luna-Rust.jl. Severity: 🔴 correctness · 🟡 robustness/CI · ⚪ informational.

## Improvement plan (2026-07-02 review)

Phased plan from the fork-vs-upstream review (`REVIEW.md` — read it first;
section numbers below refer to its findings). Each phase is independently
shippable and ordered by (severity × user impact) / effort. Gate for every
phase: full `LUNA_TEST_GROUP=All` suite green (not a subset — see the
Phase 8 lesson in `docs/native-port/PORT_LOG.md`).

### Phase A — Upstream sync (🔴, small) ✅
The fork base is upstream master minus exactly two functional commits.
1. ✅ Port `0a52ffb` (#428): fix `Polarisation.ellipse` —
   `θ = angle(Q + 1im*U)/2` (the fork's `angle(aL)/2` is always 0) — and
   restore upstream's QWP-at-π/8 regression test in
   `test/test_polarisation.jl`.
2. ✅ Port `0fd7ac2` (#427): re-add the `files=String[]` kwarg to `SSHExec`
   and the auxiliary-file `scp` loop — **merged into the fork's
   shell-escaped `Cmd`-array `runscan`, keeping the escaping** (each file
   path goes through `Base.shell_escape_posixly` / `Cmd` like the script
   does).
3. ✅ `upstream` remote now points at the real `LupoLab/Luna.jl` GitHub repo
   (was a local-disk path used only for the review). Added
   `.github/workflows/upstream_sync.yml`, a weekly scheduled job that fetches
   `upstream/master` and opens a `upstream-sync`-labelled issue if new
   commits appear past the `0a52ffb` base, so the fork never drifts silently
   again.

### Phase B — Correctness & parity fixes (🔴, small-medium) ✅
1. ✅ `PhysData._safe_n` (REVIEW §3.1): restored complex-sqrt semantics for
   all ~20 glass Sellmeier sites — `_safe_n(n2) = real(n2) < 0 ?
   sqrt(complex(n2) + 1e-10im) : sqrt(complex(n2))`, replacing the n=1
   clamp (deleted). `test/test_physdata.jl` now pins BK7 at 70nm
   (below-resonance, n²≈-3.70) against the value implied by upstream's
   plain `sqrt(complex(n2))`.
2. ✅ Rust ionisation `Emax` parity (REVIEW §3.3): `PptIonizationRate::rate`
   now clamps to `rate(e_max)` by default (matching Julia's
   `IonRatePPTAccel`), so `ppt_ionization_rate_vector` no longer triggers
   whole-vector fallbacks + warn spam above `Emax`. The old strict-error
   behaviour is still available via a `.strict(true)` builder method for
   debugging. `test/test_ionisation_rust.jl` and
   `luna-rust/src/lib.rs::test_ppt_ionization_cutoff` updated to assert the
   clamp (and the opt-in strict error).
3. ✅ Density z-independence guard (REVIEW §3.4): `RustNativeStepper` now
   calls `_check_density_zindependent(f!.densityfun, flength)` before
   baking `densityfun(0)` into a constant, for all four non-z-dep native
   paths (mode-averaged, radial, modal, free-space) — samples at
   `(0, flength/2, flength)` when `flength` is finite, else `(0, 1, 2)` as a
   cheap non-constness probe. Throws `NativeIneligible` on mismatch instead
   of silently freezing a z-varying density (covers the Raman density too,
   since it reads the same `densityfun`). New test
   `test/test_native_density_guard.jl`.
4. ✅ README: qualified the Windows support claim (scans not process-safe)
   until Phase G lands.

Gate: `LUNA_TEST_GROUP=All` — 46598 passed, 12 broken (pre-existing), 0
failed/errored.

### Phase C — Make the default workload actually native (🔴🔥, medium) ✅
REVIEW §3.2: default field-resolved `prop_capillary` (plasma on by default:
`plasma = !envelope`) falls back to the Julia stepper because the native
plasma wiring needs the `LUNA_USE_RUST_IONISATION`-gated LUT handle and
that toggle defaults to 0.
1. ✅ Decoupled: `Ionisation._make_rust_ionization_handle` now builds the
   Rust ionisation LUT whenever the library is present and *either*
   `LUNA_USE_RUST_IONISATION=1` *or* the native stepper is enabled
   (`LUNA_USE_RUST_NATIVE≠0`, the default since Phase 8). Depended on B.2
   (clamp parity), already done, so behaviour is identical either way. The
   missing-library `@warn` stays conditional on the *explicit* toggle only
   (not the native-implied case), so a fresh clone without a built Rust
   library doesn't get warning spam on every `IonRatePPTAccel` construction.
2. ✅ Added `RK45._LAST_STEPPER_TYPE`, a test hook set at the end of every
   `solve_precon` call to the concrete stepper type used (more reliable
   than `_NATIVE_FALLBACK_WARNED[]`, which is a one-time-per-session flag
   that can't distinguish "no fallback in this call" from "no fallback
   anywhere yet this session"). New
   `test/test_native_default_workload.jl` runs a **default**
   `prop_capillary` (no env toggles at all) and asserts
   `RK45._LAST_STEPPER_TYPE[] <: RK45.RustNativeStepper` — the regression
   test that would have caught §3.2.
3. ✅ Benchmarked (fixed-seed default HCF run, `docs/native-port/PORT_LOG.md`
   2026-07-02 Phase C entry): **~3.5x wall-time speedup** (0.305s → 0.087s
   for 10 accepted steps) on the exact out-of-the-box config a new user
   gets — previously 0x speedup (silent Julia fallback) despite
   `LUNA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` defaulting on since Phase 8.

Gate: all 7 test groups green — 46602 passed, 12 broken (pre-existing), 0
failed/errored (run as parallel per-group jobs, not a single sequential
`All` invocation).

### Phase D — Native scope: EnvGrid + plasma/Raman in more geometries (🟡, large)
In dependency order, each with the established gates (single-step ≤1e-13,
fixed-step full-solve, non-vacuousness check — TESTING.md §3):
1. ✅ **EnvGrid radial** — `rhs_radial_env` in `luna-rust/src/native.rs`
   (mirrors `rhs_mode_avg_env`'s c2c `to_time!`/`to_freq!` convention:
   half-spectrum zero-pad, `no/n` scale, 3/4 `Kerr_env` SVEA factor — applied
   per r-column, reusing the resident `QdhtFfiHandle::apply_cplx`). New
   `radial_eto_c`/`radial_pto_c` complex buffers in `NativeSim`, allocated by
   `native_set_radial_params` based on `sim.is_real` (already generalized:
   `n_spec_over`/`radial_eoo`/`radial_poo` needed no changes). Dispatch on
   `sim.is_real` at both `rhs_radial` call sites (`set_field`,
   RK-stage loop) — same pattern as the existing mode-averaged real/env
   split. `RK45.jl`'s radial block: dropped the `is_real_grid ||
   NativeIneligible` guard (M array, FFI buffer sizing, and the `linop isa
   Array{ComplexF64}` native-path check all already generalized to either
   grid type without further changes). New `test/test_native_radial_env.jl`:
   single-step 5.1e-17, full-solve 1.6e-15 (both far under the ~1e-12 QDHT
   double-transform floor, MATH.md §3.2), non-vacuousness confirmed (Kerr
   changes the Julia-only result by 6.8e-5 at a stronger test field — the
   equivalence tests themselves intentionally use a much weaker field where
   Kerr's own contribution is below the FP-noise floor, so vacuousness is
   checked separately rather than folded into those same runs).
2. ✅ **Plasma in radial geometry** — `apply_plasma_radial` in
   `luna-rust/src/native.rs`: the exact mode-averaged `apply_plasma_real`
   cumtrapz ×3 formula (ionization rate → cumtrapz → ρ(t) → phase → cumtrapz
   → current J with ionization-loss term → cumtrapz → polarisation P),
   applied independently per r-column into column-major `plas_*` scratch
   buffers sized `n_time_over*n_r` — matches `Et_to_Pt!`'s per-r-column
   dispatch for `TransRadial` (`PlasmaCumtrapz` always sees a scalar field
   in this geometry, so there's no cross-r coupling in the plasma response
   itself). `native_set_plasma_params` buffer sizing now branches on
   `s.is_radial`. `RK45.jl`'s radial eligibility guard relaxed from
   Kerr-only to Kerr-and/or-plasma (`NativeIneligible` still rejects Raman
   or any other response, deferred to Phase D.4), plus the same
   plasma-handle-eligibility wiring already used for mode-averaged (Phase C).
   New `test/test_native_radial_plasma.jl`: single-step 8.3e-14, full-solve
   5.1e-12 (both well under the ~1e-12 QDHT floor caveat), non-vacuousness
   confirmed via an independent, much stronger Julia-only-compared field
   (1.79e-5) — decoupled from the equivalence tests' field strength because
   PPT's extreme field-sensitivity makes the single-step tolerance and the
   non-vacuousness threshold pull in opposite directions at the same energy
   (see the test file's comments for the full reasoning and the numbers
   that ruled out a single shared field strength).
3. EnvGrid free-space (c2c 3-D FFTW plan — `fftw_plan_dft_3d`).
4. Raman in radial/modal (additive term per node, reusing the resident ADE
   solver, one oscillator state per node).
5. z-dependent `normfun` for free-space (drop the `const_norm_free`
   restriction).

Gate (D.1): all 7 test groups green — 46605 passed, 12 broken (pre-existing),
0 failed/errored.

Gate (D.2): all 7 test groups green — 46608 passed, 12 broken (pre-existing),
0 failed/errored (rust group: 41975/41975, includes 3 new tests).

### Phase E — Native scope: modal generality (🟡, large)
1. General mode orders: stable `besselj(n, x)` for n>1 (downward Miller
   recurrence) in `diffraction.rs`, unlocking TE/TM/`n>1` Marcatili modes.
2. Tapered / per-mode radius (drop the shared-constant-radius guard).
3. `full=true` (2-D modal integral — second cubature dimension).
4. npol=2 (polarisation-resolved modal), then EnvGrid modal.

### Phase F — Native scope: Raman completions + z-dependence (🟡, medium)
1. `thg=false` Raman (needs a resident Hilbert transform — one extra c2c
   FFT pair on the existing plans).
2. `RamanPolarEnv` (envelope Raman) native + the existing
   `LUNA_USE_RUST_RAMAN` follow-ups (rotational multi-oscillator per-J
   extraction; density-dependent τ2 via a `raman_update_coeffs` FFI).
3. Multi-point pressure gradients (piecewise Phase 7 — per-segment analytic
   β1 constants; `ensure_linop_at` selects the segment).
4. Gas mixtures: per-species density vector + summed susceptibilities in
   the native RHS (removes the `densityfun isa Real` guard).

### Phase G — Platform & CI robustness (🟡, small-medium)
1. Windows scan locking via `LockFileEx`/`UnlockFileEx` (existing item
   below; needs a Windows CI runner to validate).
2. GPU CI: a scheduled CUDA-equipped job running the currently
   self-skipping GPU equivalence tests (existing item below).
3. CI benchmark job: track the Phase C benchmark over time so native-path
   regressions (like §3.2) show up as perf cliffs, not silence.

### Phase H — Upstream contributions (⚪, small)
Send back as PRs to LupoLab/Luna.jl: the `DataField(fpath)` λ0-forwarding
fix, the `parse_item` eval-injection fix, the `Cmd`-array/shell-escaping
scan hardening, and the `pointcalc!` race fix if upstream ever re-adds
threading. Reduces future divergence surface.

### 🟢 Native-Rust backend port (phased)

**Goal:** make the propagation backend run **exclusively in Rust** — no Julia
callback in the per-step hot loop. **Finding:** even with all five
`LUNA_USE_RUST_*` toggles ON, ~80% of per-step cost is still Julia. The Rust
stepper (`precon_step_ffi`) drives the loop but calls Julia `fbar!`/`prop!` back
through C function pointers on **every** RK stage, so every FFT (there is no Rust
FFT), Kerr, plasma `cumtrapz`, window/norm broadcasts, and the `exp(linop)`
application stay in Julia. "Exclusively Rust" therefore requires a **resident
`NativeSim`** field + native RHS + FFTW binding, not a default-flip.

Phases (each independently shippable; gate = single-step ~1e-13 **and**
full-`solve` ~1e-6 vs the Julia oracle — see TESTING.md §3 nondeterminism floor):

- ✅ **Phase 0 — Foundations.** `NativeSim` opaque handle; FFTW binding;
  `init_native_sim` / `free_native_sim` / `set_field` / `get_field`; callback-free
  `native_step` (`RustNativeStepper` in `src/RK45.jl`). Replaces callback round-trip
  in `luna-rust/src/ffi.rs:1002` + `src/RK45.jl:309-319`. Gate passed: set/get
  bit-exact; no-op RHS rel_solve < 1e-6 (zero-RHS → bit-exact). 41928/41928 rust
  group pass. Test `test/test_native_phase0.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 1 — Mode-averaged + Kerr (RealGrid).** `rhs_mode_avg_real` +
  `native_set_mode_avg_params`; ports `to_time!`/`to_freq!`, Kerr, windows,
  `norm_mode_average`, exp-linop prop. Replaces `TransModeAvg`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:531`) + Kerr (`src/Nonlinear.jl:81`). First fully-Rust
  `prop_capillary(:HE11, Kerr)`. Gate passed: single-step ≤1e-13, full-solve
  5.8e-13. Test `test/test_native_phase1.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 2 — Plasma + EnvGrid Kerr.** `rhs_mode_avg_env` (EnvGrid c2c Kerr,
  3/4 SVEA factor) + `native_set_plasma_params`/plasma current assembly (rate
  LUT already Rust). Replaces `PlasmaCumtrapz` (`src/Nonlinear.jl:161`) +
  EnvGrid Kerr. Gate passed: Phase 2a (EnvGrid Kerr) single-step <1e-13,
  full-solve 3.2e-17; Phase 2b (RealGrid+plasma) single-step 3.8e-17,
  full-solve 2.7e-16 — all with fixed step size (see PORT_LOG 2026-07-01: the
  adaptive PI controller's near-cancellation error estimate is FP-noise
  sensitive and not itself a meaningful equivalence signal). Also fixed a
  latent `RustNativeStepper.s.y`-not-updated bug that broke `interpolate()`.
  Test `test/test_native_phase2.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 3 — Radial (TransRadial) + resident QDHT.** `rhs_radial` reuses the
  existing `QdhtFfiHandle` directly (no FFI round-trip per RHS) + a
  precomputed complex `(n_ω, n_r)` normalization array (folds `norm_radial` +
  `ωwin`, valid for a z-invariant `normfun`). Replaces `TransRadial`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:663`). Scope: RealGrid + scalar Kerr only (EnvGrid and
  plasma-radial deferred). Gate passed: single-step 1.1e-17, full-solve
  1.3e-16 (fixed step size, per the Phase 2 lesson — see PORT_LOG
  2026-07-01). Test `test/test_native_radial.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 4 — Raman.** `rhs_mode_avg_real` gains an additive Raman term via
  the resident `TimeDomainRamanSolver` (already-existing ADE solver, reused
  directly) + `native_set_raman_params`. Replaces `RamanPolarField`
  (`src/Nonlinear.jl:357`). Scope: RealGrid, `thg=true` only, all-SDO
  density-independent-τ2 eligibility (same criteria as `LUNA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`).
  Gate passed: full-solve Rust-vs-Julia 4.2e-8 — independently verified
  non-vacuous (Raman changes the Julia oracle's full-solve result by 1.1e-4,
  self-validated in-test; a single 1cm z-step alone shows Raman's
  contribution below the FP floor relative to Kerr — the effect is
  cumulative over propagation, see PORT_LOG 2026-07-01). Test
  `test/test_native_raman.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 5 — Modal (TransModal), narrow scope.** Binds the *same*
  `libcubature` C library Julia's `Cubature.jl` wraps (`Cubature_jll`,
  dlopened at runtime like FFTW — not a reimplemented cubature algorithm, so
  adaptive node placement is bit-identical, not just close). Per-node
  evaluation reuses the existing rank-1 FFT plans + Kerr formula. Scope:
  RealGrid, constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` with `kind=:HE, n=1` only (needs
  only `besselj(0,·)`/`besselj(1,·)`, already in `diffraction.rs`),
  `full=false` (the radial modal integral — what `Interface.needfull`
  already selects for `HE,n=1` mode collections, not an artificial
  restriction), Kerr-only, `shotnoise=false`. Replaces `TransModal`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:421`, `pointcalc!` `:363`, `Erω_to_Prω!` `:401`) within
  that scope. Keeps the integration loop **sequential** (prior
  `Threads.@threads` race). Gate passed: two-mode (HE11+HE12) single-step
  1.4e-19, full-solve 4.0e-16 (fixed step size) — independently verified
  non-vacuous (HE11→HE12 energy transfer is 2.0e-5 of total energy, far above
  any noise floor). General-order modes (`TE`/`TM`/`n>1`), tapered radius,
  `full=true`, EnvGrid, and Raman/plasma-in-modal are deferred (see MATH.md
  §3.3). Test `test/test_native_modal.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 6 — Free-space (TransFree).** A genuine 3-D FFTW plan
  (`fftw.rs::RealFft3d`, new `fftw_plan_dft_r2c_3d`/`_c2r_3d` symbols — same
  libfftw3 binary Julia's `FFTW.jl` uses, not a new library) replaces the
  QDHT-plus-1-D pattern Phase 3 used for radial. Dimension order
  (`(n_x,n_y,n_t)` reversed for Julia's column-major `(n_t,n_y,n_x)`) and the
  `1/(n_t·n_y·n_x)` round-trip normalization were verified against a literal
  `FFTW.rfft` reference before being trusted, not assumed from the
  row/column-major rule alone. Scope: RealGrid, `const_norm_free`
  (z-invariant), scalar Kerr, `shotnoise=false`. Replaces `TransFree`
  (`src/NonlinearRHS.jl:826`) within that scope. Gate passed: single-step
  7.05e-18, full-solve 5.01e-17 (fixed step size). EnvGrid (c2c 3-D) and a
  z-dependent `normfun` are deferred (see MATH.md §3.4). Test
  `test/test_native_free.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 7 — z-dependent linop assembly (narrow scope).** Ports the
  mode-averaged, graded-core constant-radius `MarcatiliMode` case
  (`Capillary.gradient(gas,L,p0,p1)`, a two-point pressure-gradient
  capillary) resident — `NativeSim::ensure_linop_at(z)`. `dens(pressure)` is
  a **transferred** `HermiteSpline` (Julia's own `Maths.CSpline`
  `(x,y,D)`, not re-fit — re-fitting a different spline through sampled
  values is a spline-of-a-spline problem that doesn't converge, see
  PORT_LOG). `β1(z)` is an **exact analytic closed form**, not a LUT: since
  `εco(ω;z)-1` is separable and `nwg(ω)` is z-independent, β1(z) reduces to
  4 z-independent constants computed once via `Maths.derivative` fed a
  `BigFloat` argument — see `docs/native-port/BETA1_ANALYTIC.md` for the
  derivation, why this is *more* accurate than Julia's own adaptive-FD
  `Modes.dispersion`, and the resulting tolerance tradeoff (this is the
  first phase where Rust deliberately diverges from the Julia oracle to be
  more correct, rather than a faithful bit-parity port). Also fixed: the
  nonlinear RHS's `kerr_fac`/`beta[i]` must be rescaled by `dens(z)` every
  RK stage too (`TransModeAvg` re-evaluates `densityfun(z)` fresh each
  stage) — missing this caused a ~9% full-solve mismatch, found by isolating
  that a `kerr=false` control run matched Julia while `kerr=true` didn't.
  Scope: RealGrid, Kerr-only, two-point gradient only (multi-point gradient
  and radial/free-space/modal z-dependent `nfun` deferred — see MATH.md
  §3.5). Test `test/test_native_zdep_linop.jl`. ✔
- ✅ **Phase 8 — Default-flip + cleanup.** `LUNA_USE_RUST_NATIVE` default flipped
  to `"1"`; every Phases 1-7 scope restriction converted from a hard `error()`
  to a new `NativeIneligible` exception, caught by `solve_precon` and silently
  (one-time `@warn`) falls back to the Julia stepper — native being opt-in
  used to make a scope-restriction crash the right behavior; being default
  makes it a user-facing regression instead, so it must fall back. Running
  the *entire* test suite (not just the phase-specific groups) surfaced four
  real, pre-existing gaps invisible while native was opt-in: an unrecognized
  `f!` silently ran with zero nonlinearity (`test_rk45.jl`'s raw closures);
  gas mixtures crashed with a `MethodError` instead of falling back
  (non-scalar `densityfun`); `RamanPolarEnv` (GNLSE/envelope Raman) silently
  vanished (no `isa` branch matched it — closed generally with a catch-all,
  not a special case); and, most significantly, the resident field never saw
  `Luna.run`'s per-step windowing at all (`native_step` overwrites `s.yn`
  from Rust's own state, discarding whatever Julia wrote into the pointer
  between calls) — invisible because no native-specific test drives the
  stepper through `Luna.run`, fixed via a new `native_resync_field` FFI
  called after `stepfun`. A related, separate bug (dense output between
  accepted steps was linear, not Julia's quartic `interpC`) explained nearly
  every remaining general-suite failure at once — fixed via a new
  `get_ks_stage`-based `interpolate(s::RustNativeStepper)` and
  `native_apply_prop` FFI. Full details, including the tolerance-vs-bug
  triage for each affected general-purpose test, in `PORT_LOG.md`. Test
  `test/test_native_phase8.jl`. Gate met: `LUNA_TEST_GROUP=All` — 46590
  passed, 0 failed, 0 errored, 12 broken (pre-existing), with the baseline
  (`LUNA_USE_RUST_NATIVE=0`) independently confirmed 100% green first. ✔

**Native-Rust backend port (Phases 0-8) complete.**

### 🟡 Wire remaining Rust kernels into the Julia pipeline
PPT ionization is now wired (opt-in via `LUNA_USE_RUST_IONISATION=1`).
The pattern: Rust exports an opaque handle lifecycle + a vector-eval FFI function;
Julia stores the handle in the struct and routes the in-place vector call through
`ccall`; a `@testitem tags=[:rust]` equivalence test guards the boundary.

Remaining kernels to wire (same pattern, in this order):
1. ✅ **PPT ionization** (`IonRatePPTAccel`) — `LUNA_USE_RUST_IONISATION` toggle —
   `test/test_ionisation_rust.jl`
2. ✅ **Time-domain Raman** (`raman.rs` `TimeDomainRamanSolver`) — toggle
   `LUNA_USE_RUST_RAMAN`, `init_raman_solver` / `free_raman_solver` / `raman_solve`
   exported, wired into `Nonlinear.jl` hot loop for carrier-field SDO responses
   (`CombinedRamanResponse` with all-SDO `Rs`, density-independent τ2) —
   `test/test_raman_rust.jl`. Follow-ups: rotational multi-oscillator (FFI already
   supports n_osc>1; needs Julia-side extraction of per-J Ω/K arrays);
   density-dependent τ2 (add `raman_update_coeffs` FFI entry); intermediate-broadening
   (Gaussian damping — stays Julia indefinitely); envelope (`RamanPolarEnv`) Rust path
   (needs real-buffer copy for complex→real conversion).
3. ✅ **Waveguide dispersion — Zeisberger** (`dispersion.rs` `ZeisbergerNeff`) — toggle
   `LUNA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION`, `init_zeisberger_neff` / `free_zeisberger_neff` /
   `zeisberger_neff_vector` exported, wired into `Antiresonant.jl` via a specialised
   `neff_β_grid(grid, ::ZeisbergerMode, λ0)` that batch-evaluates neff over the
   positive-frequency grid per propagation step — `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl`.
   Full Zeisberger eq.(15) parity: all four mode kinds (HE/EH/TE/TM), ϕ wall-thickness
   phase, σ⁴ real (C) and imaginary (D·loss_scale) terms. Equivalence at ~1e-12
   (same formula + Julia-supplied nco/ncl → only float-reassociation differences).
   Follow-ups: Rust-side multi-term Sellmeier (offload nco/ncl computation too);
   const-linop one-time setup path (negligible cost, left on Julia indefinitely).

3a. ✅ **Waveguide dispersion — MarcatiliMode** (`dispersion.rs` `MarcatiliNeff`) — same
    `LUNA_USE_RUST_DISPERSION` toggle; `init_marcatili_neff` / `free_marcatili_neff` /
    `marcatili_neff_vector` exported. Wired into the constant-radius specialisation
    `neff_β_grid(grid, ::MarcatiliMode{<:Number}, λ0)` in `Capillary.jl`. Nwg(ω)
    precomputed ONCE at setup (cladding-dependent, z-independent) and stored in the
    Rust handle; per step only nco(ω; z) is passed. Also adds z-level memoization
    even on the Julia-only fallback path (batching all sidcs before returning cached
    values). Equivalence is bitwise (0.0 rel error) — same IEEE 754 formula + same
    Float64 inputs. Model `:full` (`sqrt(εco-nwg)`) and `:reduced` (`1+(εco-1)/2-nwg`)
    both wired. Tests: `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl` (second `@testitem`).
4. ✅ **QDHT batch transform** — toggle `LUNA_USE_RUST_QDHT`, `init_qdht_ffi` /
   `free_qdht_ffi` / `qdht_ffi_mul_real` / `qdht_ffi_ldiv_real` / `qdht_ffi_mul_cplx` /
   `qdht_ffi_ldiv_cplx` exported. Wired into `TransRadial` in `NonlinearRHS.jl` via
   type-stable `_qdht_mul!` / `_qdht_ldiv!` dispatch. Stores Julia's T matrix
   (transposed to row-major at init); per-call transform uses Rayon parallel
   row-vector dot products with pre-allocated scratch (4×n_r×n_time), avoiding
   the two `permutedims` allocations that Julia's dim=2 QDHT path incurs.
   Handles both `Float64` (RealGrid) and `ComplexF64` interleaved (EnvGrid).
   Equivalence: ~1e-13 relative error vs Julia BLAS path (summation order differs).
   Tests: `test/test_qdht_rust.jl` (`@testitem tags=[:rust]`).
   Follow-ups: wire `TransFree` (2D Cartesian FFT, different transform type — stays Julia);
   consider cblas/openblas DGEMM binding for peak throughput.
5. ✅ **RK45 interaction-picture PreconStepper** — Dormand-Prince 5(4) with FSAL and Lund PI
   step control implemented in `ffi.rs` (`init/free/precon_step_ffi`); Julia side in
   `src/RK45.jl` (`RustPreconStepper`, `LUNA_USE_RUST_STEPPER=1`).  Key fix: `@cfunction`
   pointers must be created in `RK45.__init__` (not as precompile-image `const`s).
   Tests: `test/test_stepper_rust.jl` (physical equivalence < rtol=1e-6).

- **Safety net:** `test/test_rust_ffi.jl`, `test/test_ionisation_rust.jl`,
  `test/test_raman_rust.jl`, `test/test_dispersion_rust.jl`, and
  `luna-rust/tests/*.jl` (`@testitem tags=[:rust]`, auto-discovered).

### 🔴 Real file locking for parameter scans on Windows
`luna-rust/src/scans.rs` `FlockLock` is a **no-op on non-Unix targets** (`#[cfg(not(unix))]`
returns an empty struct; `lock()`/`unlock()` do nothing). Concurrent scans on Windows are
therefore not process-safe and may race on the shared HDF5 queue file.
- **Fix:** implement locking via Windows `LockFileEx` / `UnlockFileEx`.
- **Blocker:** needs a Windows runner to validate; untestable from Linux/macOS.
- Currently latent — `ScanQueue` is only reachable via FFI, which `src/` doesn't call yet.

### 🟡 GPU CI coverage
`luna-rust/tests/test_gpu_cuda.jl` and the GPU numerical-equivalence tests in
`luna-rust/src/lib.rs` self-skip when no GPU/CUDA is present, so the GPU code paths
(CUDA/Vulkan dispatch, GPU QDHT/Raman/ionization) are never exercised in CI.
- **Fix:** add a GPU-equipped CI runner (or a scheduled job) that actually executes them.

## Informational / no action planned

- ⚪ `deps/build.jl` forwards `ENV["RUSTFLAGS"]` (defaulting to `""` if unset),
  which neutralizes `.cargo/config.toml`'s `target-cpu=native` for package-driven
  builds. This is the intended portability safeguard (the runtime dispatcher in
  `dispatch.rs` selects the ISA at runtime); native opt only applies to a manual
  `cargo build`. **Note:** `actions-rust-lang/setup-rust-toolchain` sets
  `RUSTFLAGS=-D warnings` in CI, which propagates through `deps/build.jl` — so
  the package build runs under strict warnings (desired; keeps the Rust code clean).

## Done (recent)

- ✅ Skip-guard added to `test/test_rust_ffi.jl` and the four `luna-rust/tests/*.jl`
  testitems so a fresh-clone `]test Luna` skips (not fails) when the Rust lib is unbuilt.
- ✅ Windows scan-lock no-op documented in `scans.rs` (with `TODO`) and `luna-rust/README.md`.
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` extended with a Math & Advancements section.
- ✅ **Removed root `Cargo.toml` workspace** so `cargo build` in `luna-rust/` writes to
  `luna-rust/target/release/` (where all tests look). Root `Cargo.lock` also removed.
  Previously, the workspace redirected output to `./target/release/`, silently breaking all
  `rust` CI jobs on a clean checkout. Also fixes `rust-cache` effectiveness (caches
  `workdir: luna-rust` but output was going to root `target/`).
- ✅ **Fixed `pointcalc!` data race in `src/NonlinearRHS.jl`**: `Threads.@threads` was
  added to the `TransModal` integration loop, but the loop body writes to shared struct
  fields (`t.Erω`, `t.Prω`, `t.Prmω`, etc.). Multiple threads clobbering each other's
  intermediate buffers produced corrupted modal overlap values → RK45 rejected every step →
  `"Reached limit for step repetition (10)"` on all `physics`/`sim-interface`/`sim-multimode`
  jobs. Fixed by reverting to a sequential loop.
- ✅ **Fixed `IonRatePPTAccel` to clamp instead of throw** (`src/Ionisation.jl:419`):
  the adaptive stepper evaluates the RHS at rejected trial points; a large-field trial step
  above `Emax` is recoverable and should not crash the run. Now returns `exp(spline(Emax))`
  (saturated rate) instead of calling `error()`.
